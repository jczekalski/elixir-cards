Introductory project from the Udemy course [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/). 

The idea behind the project was to write a simple module in order to learn the basics of Elixir:
- functional programming vs. OOP
- pattern matching
- pipe operator
- ex_doc + doctest
- adding test cases
